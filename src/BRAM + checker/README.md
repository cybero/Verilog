# Verilog BRAM (Single Port) Readme
BRAM is created using Core Generator and initialized through a .coe file.

I have created a controller for the BRAM and a debouncer for a button.
Everytime you press the button, you will see the content of the RAM in the your board leds. It starts from address 0, and when you press the button it is incremented.
